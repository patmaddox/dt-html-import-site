This repo is an example set of HTML files to use with DEVONthink's "Import->Website" feature.

The goal is to import `all.html` (which contains links to the other pages), and have all of the imported pages in DEVONthink with their links working. Clicking the links should load the imported DT documents rather than requesting them from the web server.
